title: Darwin Core Archive Publication Model for OW1 Catch Data
description: >-
  Darwin Core Archive structure defining how Rutgers OW1 Bottom Trawl Survey catch data
  should be published as a DwC-A. This schema defines Event core, Occurrence extension,
  and ExtendedMeasurementOrFact (eMoF) extension classes with mappings back to source OW1 fields.
  Uses SKOS mapping predicates in reverse (DwC terms map to OW1 fields) to document
  both the semantic relationships and the publishing structure.
